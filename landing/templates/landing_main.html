  <p>Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world
  to another.</p>

  <p>If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark
  as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon. What was most
  significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon
  but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

  <p>Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may
  as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p>

    <p>Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.</p>
    <p>The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory.
    You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief,
    before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.</p>
